# Blue Candle

This Visual Studio Code theme is based on the [GitHub Theme for Obsidian](https://github.com/krios2146/obsidian-theme-github), with the addition of my primary accent color: `#FFAC4D`. It provides a cohesive and pleasant visual experience inspired by my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) setup.
